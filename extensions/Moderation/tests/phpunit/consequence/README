This directory (tests/phpunit/consequence) contains normal unit tests.

They check individual parts of the code, making use of MockConsequenceManager when possible
to avoid repeating the same operation in multiple tests.
Because of that, these tests are much faster than blackbox tests.

See also: blackbox integration testsuite (tests/phpunit/blackbox and tests/phpunit/decoupled).
