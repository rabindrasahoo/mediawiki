These are blackbox integration tests.

They use ModerationTestsuite framework (tests/phpunit/framework) to query index.php/api.php,
which results in MediaWiki being used in the same manner as when actual users do something.

These tests are rather thorough, but they have two serious disadvantages:
1) they are much slower than regular unit tests (tests/phpunit/consequence),
because invoking index.php/api.php calls way more code than what we want to test,
2) it's not possible for PHPUnit to generate code coverage report from these tests,
because they are invoked in a separate process, etc.

See also:
1) tests/phpunit/decoupled - these are also blackbox integration tests, but instead of
invidivual scenarios they check four main situations: Intercept, Queue, Render and Action.
2) tests/phpunit/consequence - regular unit tests (much faster).
