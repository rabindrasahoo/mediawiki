Auto Create Category Page 
(https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Auto_Create_Category_Page)
(what a mouthful!) is a MediaWiki extension which automatically creates
stub pages for non-existent categories as soon as they are linked to,
avoiding the confusing default behavior of "There is currently no text in
this page..." or redirecting to the edit page.


== Compatibility ==
Version 1.0.0 and beyond are compatible with MediaWiki 1.25+.
The previous version should work with MediaWiki 1.21-1.24.

== Installation ==
See INSTALL file for configuration options.

=== Caveats ===
This extension is currently not recommended for use on large wikis, as it
doesn't implement any caching of its database queries (for retrieving
the list of existing category pages).

== Credits ==
Auto Create Category Pages was originally created as
"Uniwiki Auto Create Category Pages" by Merrick Schaefer, Mark Johnston,
Evan Wheeler & Adam Mckaig, as part of the Uniwiki project for UNICEF
(see [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:Uniwiki Category:Uniwiki]).


As Uniwiki extensions for MediaWiki are not maintained by the original
developers anymore (according to an e-mail by Mark Johnston from Nov 9, 2012 ),
the maintenance of this one extension was taken up by 
[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:FreedomFighterSparrow Dror S.]

== License ==
The extension was released under GPLv3. See LICENSE file for more details.
