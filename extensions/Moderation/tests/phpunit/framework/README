This is ModerationTestsuite framework, which is used by blackbox integration tests:
1) tests/phpunit/blackbox/ - individual tests.
2) tests/phpunit/decoupled/ - decoupled tests: Intercept, Queue, Render and Action.

This framework is NOT used by regular unit tests (tests/phpunit/consequence/*.php).
